Conveniently, Keras has a built-in [IMDb movie reviews dataset](https://keras.io/datasets/#imdb-movie-reviews-sentiment-classification) that we can use, with the same vocabulary size."

    "> **Tip**: You can split off a small portion of the training set to be used for validation during training. This will help monitor the training process and identify potential overfitting. You can supply a validation set to `model.fit()` using its `validation_data` parameter, or just specify `validation_split` - a fraction of the training data for Keras to set aside for this purpose (typically 5-10%). Validation metrics are evaluated once at the end of each epoch."
